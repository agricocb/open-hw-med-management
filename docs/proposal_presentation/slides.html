# Open Hardware
# Medication Management

<br/><br/>

Proposer: Craig Agricola

---

# Project background

### Why should we care about medication management?

- It's not really that hard to remember to take medicine, is it?

--

- It's not, but mostly for two reasons:
  - The vast majority of what we take is short term
  - A lot of what we take we are driven to take because of symptoms

--

- Remembering to consistently take long term medication is surprisingly
  difficult
  - The symptoms are often not acute until *after* we forget to take them
  - After a few weeks, we don't think about it as actively

???

---

# Project background
### Why should we care about medication management?

- There are three groups who are especially prone to forgetting:

--

  - Adults with normal memory, but who are distracted by chaotic lives

--

  - Older adults with the memory issues associated with aging

--

  - Children

--

     - This was my personal reason to think about the problem

???

   - Personal anecdote
     - I've got 4 kids, and management of their meds between two parents
       implied a lot of coordinated communication, which often didn't happen

---

# Project background
### Why should we care about medication management?

- Technology should be able to help!

  - For the distracted adults, it makes sense to outsource the work of paying
    attention to a smart device

  - For children, and at least a subset of the elderly, a caretaker is often
    part of the solution

     - Getting reminders and checking status, even remotely is a huge help

Solutions already available
 - Local pill reminders
   - Bottle caps with an alarm clock in them
   - Mobile apps that remind you
 - Commercially managed pill reminders
   - Left one is about $200
   - Right one is about $800

#Solutions already available

 - Localized solutions
   - Pill containers with a built in alarm clock
   - Mobile reminder apps

 - Commercially managed pill reminders with monitoring
   - Fairly expensive
   - Monitoring requires a recurring fee

???

 - IoT reminders?
   - You manage it, but with help from the technology
     - No service to rely on or fees to support that service
   - It fits somewhere between the above two solutions
     - It's really a DIY solution, that appeals to the DIY/Maker mindset

---

#Solutions already available

 - What about the Internet of Things?

--

   - Shouldn't we be able to manage it ourselves
     - No recurring service fees

   - This solution fits somewhere between the other two solutions
     - It's really a DIY solution, that will appeal to the DIY/Maker mindset

#Proposed Solution
###Create an open hardware/software/protocol solution

   - Define a standard for an embedded microprocessor that connects pill
     containers & dispensors to the IoT (Internet of Things)

     - The embedded processor handles:

       - connection and communication to the internet

       - a very simple interface to the pill container/dispensor

     - Makes designing/producing the mechanics of the pill container or
       dispensor simply a focus on the mechanics, rather than the IoT
       connectivity

???

---

#Proposed Solution
###Create mobile apps to interface with the IoT hardware

   - The app handles the "business logic" of the medication management

     - Alarms when medication should be taken *or*

     - Alarms when medication hasn't been taken yet, but should have

     - Triggers the dispensing of pills for pill dispensor hardware

       - This can/should be authenticated, both in protocol and possibly in app
         interface for locking pill dispensors

   - The app should be tolerant of multiple mobile devices coordinating the
     management

   - The app should be tolerant of managing multiple embedded processors

???

#Project proposal

???

Project proposal
 - Flesh out and document the interfaces
   - Between embedded microprocessor an the pill hardware
     - I anticipate a 3 wire interface for "dumb" devices
       - Ground + Activate signal + Monitor signal
         - This covers a container that beeps/flashes a light as a reminder,
           and monitors that the container was opened
         - Covers a mechanism that can be powered until a sensor sees a pill be
           dispensed; the MCU sets the activate wire high until the monitor
           signal goes high.
     - Also a 3 wire interface for "smart" devices
       - Probably a I2C interface with some minimal authentication
       - Allows one internet connected MCU to control many pill mechanisms
         with the help of a much lower cost/complexity helper MCU
       - Probably desirable for "locking" dispensors when the internet
         connected MCU might be outside of the hardware mechanism.
   - Between the embedded MCU and the mobile apps
     - Push notification from MCU to internet message board
     - Pull notification from internet message board to mobile apps
 - Implement a reference design of the embedded microprocessor
   - Originally I envisioned an Arduino with a WiFi shield or a Raspberry Pi
     with a WiFi USB dongle
   - Spark.io Core has become available in the last year, and is much better
     suited
     - Reference design will probably be a bread-boarded Spark.io Core
 - Implement a mock up design for a pill dispensor using the 3-wire dumb
   interface
 - Implement an iOS app that provides
   - Pro-active or re-active alarms
   - Triggering the dispensing of pills
   - Handles authentication and different levels of authorization (per pill
     dispensor device)
 - Stretch goals
   - Implement an Android app with the iOS app functionality
   - Create Gerber files for a PCB for possible productization of the MCU
   - Create an enclosure (or even just a 3D model enclosure design) for the
     Spark.io Core or the custom PCB
   - Implement a reference design for a pill container using the 3-wire dumb
     interface
   - Implement a mock up design for a pill dispensor using the I2C interface

#Proposed organizational plan

???

Proposed organizational plan
 - GitHub with the traditional pull-request model
   - I have a project started on GitHub
   - Everybody should have a GitHub account, and will fork the project
   - When contributions are ready to be fed back up to the main project, you'll
     create a pull request for me to pull it in
     - Pull requests can easily be made between people who are working together
       between official releases to the main repository
 - If anybody has a good reason for the project to stay private during
   development, I have a personal Git server in a data center that I could give
   everyone access to
   - I'd still anticipate using the same pull-request model between personal
     clones of the project
   - Ultimately, I anticipate it ending up on GitHub (as an Open Hardware/Open
     Source project), but if desired by individual contributors, the history
     could be collapsed

#IP Agreement

???

IP Agreement
 - I'll retain rights to the architecture and specifications of the protocol
 - I envision this as living in the Open Source/Open Hardware ecosystem
   - You retain copyright to the code/contributions that you write
   - Marketability in this ecosystem is different than in most commercial
     environments
     - People buy pre-made devices to save time and gain cost benefits of scale
     - People buy (more rarely) software to save time in building the software
       - or to get support on the software
   - So profit sharing would be differentiated based on who worked on the
     hardware team vs the software team
     - For the software team, if the app was able to be sold on the app store,
       the profits would be split evenly between the coders of the app and me
       (regardless of the amount of code written by any of us)
     - Similarly for the profits on an Android version of the app, evenly
       between the contributors to the codebase of the Android app
     - For the hardware team, if the hardware turned out to be commercially
       viable to produce and sell, the contributors would be invited to
       participate in building a company (which implies probable financial
       investment) to produce and then sell the hardware.  The share of the
       profits would be negotiable as the company was being formally formed,
       and would be mutually agreed upon based on the contribution of the
       participants to the design and the monetary investment made to support
       the creation of the company.
